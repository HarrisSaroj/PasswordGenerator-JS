# PasswordGenerator-JS
 A password generator project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a fun and practical project that can help users create strong and secure passwords. 

- HTML Structure: Set up the HTML structure for the password generator elements. You'll need input fields for the password length and options for character types such as lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Styling and CSS: Apply CSS styles to the password generator elements to make them visually appealing and responsive. You can use CSS to add animations or effects when the password is generated.
- JavaScript Event Listeners: Use JavaScript to add event listeners to the password generator elements. Listen for the submit button to be clicked and capture the input values for the password length and character types.
- Password Generation Algorithm: Use a JavaScript algorithm to generate a random password based on the user's input values. You can use a combination of string manipulation, loops, and conditionals to generate a password that meets the user's requirements.
- Copy to Clipboard: Implement a feature to allow users to copy the generated password to their clipboard for easy use. You can use the Clipboard API to achieve this functionality.
